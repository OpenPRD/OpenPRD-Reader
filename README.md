# OpenPRD File Viewer

This is a application that allows you to view Open Portable Resume Document (OpenPRD) files and see both the resume and the structured data.

## Usage

To use the application, simply drag and drop an OpenPRD file onto the drop zone. The application will display both the resume and the structured data in separate panels.

The resume panel will display the resume in a nicely formatted way, just like a regular resume. The structured data panel will display the data in JSON format, with each section of the resume separated into its own object.

You can also use the navigation buttons at the top of the application to switch between different resumes if you have uploaded multiple files.
